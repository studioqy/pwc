# PWC

**Code from the PWF class [Fall 2021]**

**Language:** C#
**Prerequisites:** PBB, PWF

_This class directly follows the PWF class. It focuses specifically on object-oriented programming._

The course covered the following concepts:

| Week(s) | Concepts                          |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1       | Intro                             |
| 2       | Review                            |
| 3 - 4   | Calling Functions                 |
| 5 - 6   | Writing Functions                 |
| 7 - 8   | Tests/Dictionaries                |
| 9 - 10  | Data Analysis/Handling Exceptions |
| 11 - 13 | Using Objects/Project             |

The class generally followed a weekly pattern, each consisted of a solo checkpoint and a larger team programming project. As such, the class focused a lot on collaborating on a team to design and develop projects.

The class encouraged students to add something extra, so many for the assignments exceed the original assignment's requirements.

The code in this repository does not include all of the code made in this class, just many of the important assignments that I still have. They are as follows:
